## ðŸ“– Saturday â€“ Grammar Deep Dive

### 1. Pick a single "hard" structure
e.g. è¿ž â€¦ éƒ½ (ä¹Ÿ) to mean "evenâ€¦"

### 2. Study authoritatively on Chinese Grammar Wiki
- Explanation + patterns + multiple examples
- [Example: Expressing "even" with "lian" and "dou"](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/expressing_%22even%22_with_%22lian%22_and_%22dou%22)
- For other advanced points, browse the [C1 grammar points list](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/C1_grammar_points)

### 3. Active practice
- Copy 3 example sentences from the Wiki
- Write 5 original sentences of your ownâ€”use that pattern with vocabulary you know
- Record yourself speaking them aloud (phone voice memo)
- Check/correct via language-exchange (Tandem/HelloTalk) or a writing-correction community (Lang-8)

### 4. Reinforcement
- Flag any "leech" cards in Anki, add these new example sentences as flashcards
- At your next Du Chinese or The Chairman's Bao session, spot the pattern in real text
