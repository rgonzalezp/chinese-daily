## 🎧 Friday – Targeted Podcast Practice

### 1. Slow-speed input → "Slow Chinese" (慢速中文)

A cultural podcast read at ~2–3 characters/sec.

**Why?** Builds listening confidence: you can follow ≥80% of the audio before bumping up speed.

**How to use it:**
- Pick an episode (~5–8 min)—e.g. "204 – 美图秀秀"
- Listen without transcript; note down 5 keywords you catch
- Read along the transcript on the site, filling gaps
- Shadow (speak along) at slow speed for 1–2 min

### 2. Native-speed reinforcement → "Mandarin Bean"

Short (~3–5 min) HSK-3/4-level stories, read at normal pace, with full transcripts and English.

**Why?** Bridges the gap to real‐world speed, reinforces new vocab in context.

**How to use it:**
- Choose a tag/topic you like
- Listen once straight through, then again with transcript
- Shadow key sentences at full speed, mimicking intonation
