# Feature TODO List

- **Keyword Cards in Calendar:** Implement a feature where we add a card/indicator inside the calendar cell for a specific date. The card would display one or a few keywords extracted from the notes saved for that day. This might involve generating embeddings from the notes text to find the most relevant keywords.
- **Task Checkboxes:** [ x ]Enhance the rendering of task list items (from the `tasks/*.md` files) to include interactive checkboxes. Persist the checked state of these boxes, likely associated with the specific date being viewed.
- **Saved Note Preview:** When viewing/editing notes for a specific date, add a separate, read-only preview area (perhaps a right sidebar/panel) that displays the *last successfully saved* version of the notes for that date, rendered as Markdown. 
- **Hide template:** two possibilities. Fully hide the tasks week bar behind a button or make it shorter and on hover make a preview of the tasks pop(which would be just a preview of markdown again). The pop should be like a sliding window coming out
