## 🎧 Friday – Targeted Podcast Practice

### 1. Slow-speed input → "Slow Chinese" (慢速中文)

A cultural podcast read at ~2–3 characters/sec.

**Why?** Builds listening confidence: you can follow ≥80% of the audio before bumping up speed.

**How to use it:**
- Pick an episode (~5–8 min)—e.g. "204 – 美图秀秀"
- Listen without transcript; note down 5 keywords you catch
- Read along the transcript on the site, filling gaps
- Shadow (speak along) at slow speed for 1–2 min

### 2. Native-speed reinforcement → "Mandarin Bean"

Short (~3–5 min) HSK-3/4-level stories, read at normal pace, with full transcripts and English.

**Why?** Bridges the gap to real‐world speed, reinforces new vocab in context.

**How to use it:**
- Choose a tag/topic you like
- Listen once straight through, then again with transcript
- Shadow key sentences at full speed, mimicking intonation

## 📖 Saturday – Grammar Deep Dive

### 1. Pick a single "hard" structure
e.g. 连 … 都 (也) to mean "even…"

### 2. Study authoritatively on Chinese Grammar Wiki
- Explanation + patterns + multiple examples
- [Example: Expressing "even" with "lian" and "dou"](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/expressing_%22even%22_with_%22lian%22_and_%22dou%22)
- For other advanced points, browse the [C1 grammar points list](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/C1_grammar_points)

### 3. Active practice
- Copy 3 example sentences from the Wiki
- Write 5 original sentences of your own—use that pattern with vocabulary you know
- Record yourself speaking them aloud (phone voice memo)
- Check/correct via language-exchange (Tandem/HelloTalk) or a writing-correction community (Lang-8)

### 4. Reinforcement
- Flag any "leech" cards in Anki, add these new example sentences as flashcards
- At your next Du Chinese or The Chairman's Bao session, spot the pattern in real text
